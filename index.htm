  <h1>John Dixon</h1>
  <p>
    <em><strong>Web Master </strong>since 1999</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    I began my career at RealWorld Software in 1999 as the new Webmaster. The company was bought out 18 months later by Great Planes Software, which, in turn, was bought by Microsoft half a year after that.</p>
  <p>
    I went on to work with Fortune 500 companies and small businesses in Syracuse, NY and later in the Tampa Bay area in Florida, culminating in working in Los Angeles for five years as a Web Master and Digital Media Specialist.</p>
  <p>
    I returned to New Hampshire in 2015 after my father passed to be closer to my mother and help her with my disabled brother, and to finally be close to my newly adult-age daughter.
